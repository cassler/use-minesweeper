# PRISM Typescript/Tailwind/Vite POC

## Dev Quickstart

`yarn & yarn dev` To install dependencies and launch a dev server:

`yarn build` To build minified ES/JS and CSS distributables

## Folders

### `/lib`

This is where your main component library code lives. Only the contents of this folder will be included with a build output.

### `/src`

This is where a ViteJS powered SPA resides with full access to your library. This is useful for development iteration. This is not included in the build output.
